    "openai": "AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence. It refers to a form of artificial intelligence that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human beings. Unlike narrow or specialized AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks (like language translation or playing chess), AGI would have the capability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. The ultimate goal of AGI is to create machines that can reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience, thereby having a broad, adaptable intelligence akin to human cognitive capabilities. As of now, AGI remains a theoretical concept and has not yet been realized.",

    "gemini": "AGI stands for **Artificial General Intelligence**. It refers to a hypothetical level of artificial intelligence that possesses the ability to:\n\n*   **Understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks**, much like a human being.\n*   **Reason abstractly, think creatively, and solve novel problems** that it hasn't been explicitly trained on.\n*   **Adapt and generalize its learning** to new situations and domains.\n*   **Exhibit common sense and intuitive understanding** of the world.\n*   **Potentially achieve human-level cognitive performance, or even surpass it.**\n\n**Key Differences from Current AI (Narrow AI):**\n\nCurrent AI systems, often referred to as **Narrow AI** or **Weak AI**, are designed to perform specific tasks very well. Examples include:\n\n*   Image recognition\n*   Natural language processing (for tasks like translation or chatbots)\n*   Playing games like chess or Go\n\nWhile these systems can outperform humans in their specialized domains, they lack the general intelligence and adaptability of AGI. They cannot transfer their knowledge to other domains or reason about the world in a broader context.\n\n**In essence, AGI would be an AI that can \"think for itself\" in a more comprehensive and flexible way than current AI systems.**\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **AGI is still largely theoretical.** While there's significant progress in AI, we are not yet close to achieving AGI.\n*   **There's no universally agreed-upon definition of AGI.** The criteria for defining when an AI system has achieved general intelligence are still debated.\n*   **AGI raises significant ethical and societal implications.** If AGI were to be achieved, it could have profound impacts on employment, security, and the future of humanity.\n\nIn summary, AGI is a theoretical form of AI that possesses human-level general intelligence, capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks, and adapting to new situations. It represents a significant advancement beyond the current state of narrow AI."
