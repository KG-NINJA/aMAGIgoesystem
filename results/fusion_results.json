    "openai": "The question of the meaning of life has been contemplated by philosophers, theologians, and thinkers throughout history, and it doesn't have a one-size-fits-all answer. For some, the meaning of life is found in religious or spiritual beliefs, which may involve serving a higher power or fulfilling a divine purpose. Others may find meaning through personal fulfillment, relationships, or contributions to society or knowledge. Existentialists suggest that life has no inherent meaning and that it is up to each individual to create their own purpose. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal question and can vary greatly from person to person.",

    "gemini": "Ah, the million-dollar question! The meaning of life is one of the oldest and most debated philosophical questions in history. There's no single, universally accepted answer, and that's kind of the point. The meaning of life is often what you *make* it.\n\nHere's a breakdown of some common perspectives and ideas:\n\n**1. Nihilism:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Life is inherently without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.\n*   **Implication:** You are free to create your own meaning, or accept the lack of inherent meaning.  Embrace freedom and experience without searching for grand narratives.\n\n**2. Existentialism:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Existence precedes essence.  We are born into the world without a predetermined purpose. We are free to define ourselves through our choices and actions.\n*   **Implication:**  Embrace responsibility for your choices. Create your own values and live authentically, even in the face of absurdity.  Key figures include Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.\n\n**3. Absurdism:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** The search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd.  There's a fundamental conflict between humanity's desire for meaning and the universe's lack of it.\n*   **Implication:** Instead of trying to resolve the absurdity, one should embrace it and rebel against it through action and creativity.  Albert Camus is a key figure.\n\n**4. Hedonism:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Pleasure and happiness are the ultimate goals of life.\n*   **Implication:** Maximize pleasure and minimize pain. This can range from seeking simple pleasures to pursuing more complex and fulfilling experiences.\n\n**5. Eudaimonia (Flourishing):**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** A life well-lived, characterized by virtue, excellence, and fulfillment. Often associated with Aristotelian philosophy.\n*   **Implication:** Cultivate virtues, develop your potential, and contribute to the well-being of yourself and others.\n\n**6. Meaning Found in Relationships and Connection:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Human beings are social creatures, and meaningful connections with others are essential for a fulfilling life.\n*   **Implication:** Nurture relationships, practice empathy and compassion, and contribute to your community.\n\n**7. Meaning Found in Contribution and Purpose:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Finding a purpose or contributing to something larger than oneself provides meaning.\n*   **Implication:** Discover your passions, use your skills and talents to make a difference, and work towards goals that are meaningful to you. This could involve your career, volunteering, creative pursuits, or activism.\n\n**8. Spiritual and Religious Perspectives:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Life has meaning through a connection with a higher power or a divine purpose. This varies greatly depending on the specific religion or spiritual belief system.\n*   **Implication:**  Follow the teachings of your faith, seek spiritual enlightenment, and connect with the divine.\n\n**9. Stoicism:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Finding peace and fulfillment by focusing on what you can control (your thoughts and actions) and accepting what you cannot.\n*   **Implication:**  Cultivate inner resilience, practice self-control, and live in accordance with nature.\n\n**How to Find *Your* Meaning:**\n\nThe most important thing is to consider what *you* find meaningful. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n*   What makes you feel alive and energized?\n*   What are you passionate about?\n*   What do you value most in life?\n*   What kind of impact do you want to have on the world?\n*   What brings you joy, peace, and a sense of purpose?\n\n**In summary, the meaning of life is not a fixed destination but a journey of self-discovery.  It's about finding what gives your life purpose and living in accordance with your values.**\n\nDon't be afraid to experiment, explore different philosophies, and create your own unique meaning. The beauty of it is that it's entirely up to you! Good luck on your quest!"
