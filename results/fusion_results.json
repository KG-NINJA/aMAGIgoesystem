    "openai": "The meaning of life is a deeply philosophical question that has been contemplated by humans for centuries. Different cultures, religions, and philosophies offer various interpretations:\n\n1. **Religious Perspectives**: Many religions provide specific purposes for human existence, often related to spiritual fulfillment and alignment with divine will. For example, Christianity often sees life's purpose as serving God and attaining eternal life, while Buddhism may view it as achieving enlightenment and escaping the cycle of rebirth.\n\n2. **Philosophical Perspectives**: Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre argue that life has no intrinsic meaning, and it is up to individuals to create their own purpose through actions and choices. In contrast, some philosophers, such as Aristotle, propose that meaning comes from living virtuously and realizing one's potential.\n\n3. **Scientific and Secular Perspectives**: From a scientific standpoint, life can be seen as a result of evolutionary processes without any inherent purpose. Some secular humanists find meaning through contributing to the well-being of humanity and the planet.\n\nUltimately, the meaning of life can be a personal quest. People often find it through relationships, work, personal growth, and the pursuit of happiness and knowledge.",

    "gemini": "Ah, the big question! The meaning of life is one of those questions that philosophers, theologians, scientists, and individuals have pondered for centuries, and there's no single, universally accepted answer. It's a deeply personal and subjective question.\n\nHere's a breakdown of some common perspectives:\n\n**1. Nihilism:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Life is inherently without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. There is no grand plan or ultimate reason for existence.\n*   **Implication:** This can be seen as liberating, allowing individuals to create their own meaning. Or, it can lead to despair.\n\n**2. Existentialism:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Life has no inherent meaning, but we are free to create our own. We are responsible for our choices and actions. Meaning is not found, but created.\n*   **Implication:** Focus on authentic living, taking responsibility, and creating personal values.\n\n**3. Absurdism:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** The search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd. There is a fundamental conflict between our desire for meaning and the apparent lack of it in the world.\n*   **Implication:** Embrace the absurdity, revolt against it by living passionately and authentically despite the meaninglessness.\n\n**4. Hedonism:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain is the primary goal in life.\n*   **Implication:** Focus on experiences that bring joy, happiness, and satisfaction.\n\n**5. Eudaimonia (Aristotelian Philosophy):**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Flourishing, living well, and doing well.  It's not just about happiness, but about realizing one's full potential as a human being.\n*   **Implication:** Cultivate virtues, develop talents, and engage in activities that contribute to a meaningful and fulfilling life.\n\n**6. Meaning Through Purpose/Contribution:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Finding meaning in contributing to something larger than oneself, such as helping others, advancing knowledge, creating art, or making the world a better place.\n*   **Implication:** Identify a cause or purpose that resonates with you and dedicate your time and energy to it.\n\n**7. Meaning Through Relationships:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** The connections we form with others – family, friends, community – provide meaning and support.\n*   **Implication:** Nurture relationships, cultivate empathy, and contribute to the well-being of others.\n\n**8. Spiritual/Religious Perspectives:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Life's meaning is found in connection with a higher power, adherence to religious doctrines, and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment.\n*   **Implication:** Follow religious teachings, engage in prayer or meditation, and strive for spiritual growth.\n\n**9. Biological/Evolutionary Perspective:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Life's primary purpose is survival and reproduction, ensuring the continuation of the species.\n*   **Implication:** This perspective might not provide a sense of personal meaning, but it helps explain the fundamental drivers of life.\n\n**10. Personal Meaning:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Meaning is subjective and personal. It's up to each individual to define what makes their life meaningful.\n*   **Implication:** Explore your values, interests, and passions. Reflect on your experiences and identify what gives your life purpose and joy.\n\n**How to Find Your Own Meaning:**\n\n*   **Self-Reflection:**  What are your values?  What do you care about? What brings you joy and fulfillment?\n*   **Experimentation:**  Try new things, explore different interests, and step outside your comfort zone.\n*   **Connection:**  Build meaningful relationships with others.\n*   **Contribution:**  Find ways to give back to your community or the world.\n*   **Mindfulness:**  Pay attention to the present moment and appreciate the simple things in life.\n*   **Learn and Grow:**  Continuously seek knowledge, develop your skills, and challenge yourself.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe meaning of life is not a fixed answer waiting to be discovered, but rather a journey of exploration and creation. It's about finding what resonates with you, what gives your life purpose, and what makes you feel alive.  It's okay if your meaning evolves over time as you grow and change. The important thing is to keep searching and keep creating.\n\nWhat gives *your* life meaning? That's the most important question."
