    "openai": "The meaning of life is a question that has been explored by philosophers, theologians, scientists, and thinkers for centuries, and different perspectives offer various answers. Some see it through a religious or spiritual lens, finding meaning in connection to a higher power or in fulfilling a particular purpose laid out by a divine being. Others find meaning through human-centric views, such as the pursuit of happiness, personal growth, love, and relationships. Some philosophical perspectives suggest that life has no inherent meaning, positing existential or nihilistic viewpoints, where individuals must create their own meaning. Science often doesn't provide explicit meaning but instead explores life's mechanisms, origin, and evolution. Ultimately, the meaning of life can vary greatly depending on personal beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and individual experiences.",

    "gemini": "Ah, the million-dollar question! There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life. It's a question that philosophers, theologians, scientists, and individuals have pondered for centuries. The beauty of it is that the meaning of life is often what you make it.\n\nHere's a breakdown of some common perspectives and ideas:\n\n*   **Nihilism:** This perspective suggests that life is inherently without meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Life is essentially absurd.\n\n*   **Existentialism:** Existentialists believe that life has no inherent meaning, but that individuals are free to create their own meaning through their choices and actions. Responsibility and freedom are key.\n\n*   **Absurdism:** Similar to nihilism, absurdism recognizes the conflict between humanity's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. Absurdists advocate for embracing the absurdity and rebelling against it by living authentically.\n\n*   **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain is the primary goal and meaning of life.\n\n*   **Purpose-Driven Life:** This view suggests that life has a pre-ordained purpose, often connected to a higher power or religious belief. Discovering and fulfilling that purpose brings meaning.\n\n*   **Humanism:** Emphasizes human reason, ethics, and justice, focusing on improving the well-being of humanity. Meaning comes from contributing to society and making the world a better place.\n\n*   **Personal Meaning:** This is where you define your own meaning of life. It could be:\n\n    *   **Relationships:** Finding meaning in love, friendship, and connection with others.\n    *   **Contribution:** Making a difference in the world through work, volunteering, or creative endeavors.\n    *   **Growth:** Continuously learning, evolving, and becoming a better version of yourself.\n    *   **Experiences:** Seeking out new and enriching experiences, whether through travel, adventure, or art.\n    *   **Inner Peace:** Cultivating mindfulness, gratitude, and contentment.\n    *   **Legacy:** What mark you want to leave on the world after you're gone.\n\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal and evolving concept. It's okay to not have all the answers and to change your perspective over time. Consider exploring different philosophies, reflecting on your values, and experimenting with different activities to discover what truly resonates with you and gives your life meaning.\n\nInstead of searching for *the* meaning, maybe focus on what *your* meaning is. What brings you joy, what are you passionate about, what kind of person do you want to be? These questions can lead you to your own, unique understanding of the meaning of *your* life."
