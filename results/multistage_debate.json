    "ethics": "# CASPER-3 (Ethics) - Round 2 Refined Analysis\n\n## Unanimous Conclusion Across All Three Magi\n\n**INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE**\n\n## Synthesized Position\n\nAll three analysis systems (CASPER-3, BALTHASAR-2, and MELCHIOR-1) independently reached the identical conclusion: the requested analysis cannot be performed due to complete absence of evidentiary material.\n\n## Evidence-Grounded Assessment\n\n### Temporal Constraint\nThe query requests analysis \"as of October 20, 2025\" - a future date relative to the available data cutoff of October 2023. No information exists in the provided evidence base for this timeframe.\n\n### Source Material Gap\nZero citations, URLs, or content are present in the Web Intelligence Summary regarding:\n- Ransomware incidents in 2025\n- AWS outages or failures in 2025  \n- Any correlation between ransomware and AWS infrastructure issues in the specified timeframe\n- Japanese language sources (日本語) on these topics for 2025\n- English language sources on these topics for 2025\n\n### Methodological Impossibility\nWithout Stage 0 citations or source material, no evidence-based analysis can be conducted. Any response beyond acknowledging this evidentiary gap would constitute:\n- Speculation about future events\n- Fabrication of claims without foundation\n- Violation of the core constraint to use ONLY provided citations\n\n## Final Determination\n\n**The query cannot be answered with available evidence. No analysis of the ransomware-AWS relationship for October 2025 is possible given the complete absence of source material from that timeframe.**",

  "stage3_meta_consensus": "## META-CONSENSUS ANALYSIS\n\n### Points of Convergence\nAll three AI perspectives—Logic (BALTHASAR-2), Ethics (CASPER-3), and Intuition (MELCHIOR-1)—unanimously converge on the conclusion of \"INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" regarding the analysis of ransomware issues and AWS outages as of October 20, 2025. The primary reasons for this consensus are as follows:\n1. **Temporal Constraint**: The request pertains to a date (October 20, 2025) that exceeds the data cut-off of October 2023, highlighting a temporal gap that prohibits current analysis.\n2. **Lack of Source Material**: There is a complete absence of source material or data on the topics requested (ransomware incidents and AWS outages) for the specified future date.\n3. **Methodological Limitations**: The inability to conduct an analysis without speculative or fabricated content due to the absence of evidence is acknowledged by all perspectives.\n\n### Valuable Divergences\nThere are no significant divergences present among the AI perspectives, as their conclusions are aligned due to the clear limitations imposed by the data cut-off and the absence of evidence. Each perspective highlights a different aspect of this alignment:\n- **Logic Perspective** (BALTHASAR-2): Focuses on the methodological impossibility of analysis without data.\n- **Ethics Perspective** (CASPER-3): Emphasizes the ethical constraints against speculation or fabrication absent source material.\n- **Intuition Perspective** (MELCHIOR-1): Recognizes the overall impossibility due to the temporal limitation.\n\n### Synthesized Conclusion\nConsidering the unanimous agreement among the AI perspectives, the meta-consensus conclusion is that the requested analysis cannot be performed. The reasons include the lack of data as of October 2025 and the ethical constraints against forming an analysis without supporting evidence. Any attempt to provide an answer would not only be speculative but also violate the principle of evidence-based analysis.\n\n### Confidence Level\nThe confidence level in this conclusion is **High**, given the strong alignment and consistency across all provided perspectives, as well as the clear evidential and methodological constraints.\n\n### Final Recommendation\nAcknowledge the limitation of the current data scope and inform the requester that the analysis will be feasible only when data from or beyond the cut-off date becomes available. Encourage the requester to revisit the query with updated information sources in the future.",
